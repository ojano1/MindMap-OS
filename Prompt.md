I’m developing a custom **Obsidian plugin called MindMap OS**, designed as a productivity framework that can evolve into a **Kickstarter product** and later a **D2C digital tool**. The plugin already compiles successfully, creates new tasks via command, and uses `main.ts` at the root with helpers in `src/core/` (`scaffold.ts`, `periodics.ts`, `router.ts`, `utils.ts`, `fm.ts`). It builds with **TypeScript + esbuild** and deploys directly into my Obsidian vault using `npm run deploy`.

The goal is to position **MindMap OS** as a **visual productivity operating system** — compatible with top productivity hacks and books, and a natural **enabler for systems thinkers** who prefer visuals, mind maps, and free-form linking instead of rigid Notion templates. The product is still flexible and can be tweaked for **Kickstarter appeal**, with future expansions like an **expense tracker**, **women’s health and fertility tracker**, and other life-management modules. Two streams will need to develop in parallel: **marketing** (story, visuals, Kickstarter positioning) and **production** (plugin refinement, features, and ecosystem).
