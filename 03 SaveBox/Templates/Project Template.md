This page is for one concrete deliverable that moves your goal forward.  
Now break this goal into smaller projects you can complete and measure.

---

## Projects
List clear, finishable projects.  
Use links to create each project page (prefix: `Project – `).

*Structure:*  
Deliverable + scope + due date.  
*Example:*  
- [[Project – Build Product MVP by Dec 15]]  
- [[Project – Create 5-Email Launch Sequence by Jan 10]]  

*Your projects:*  
- [[Project – ]]
- 

(Click a link to open the project page and break it into tasks.)
